My name is Carlos, I love to learn and my cats, my strength could be that I like to learn new stuff everyday, and I'm here to prove that I can pass this test.

My linkedin is https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-basurto-44a1b5125/, phone number: +51 991 851 617 and my email address is carlosxd753@gmail.com

I like to play videogames, listen to music and play with my cats. Completed a course from Google and got my certificate about automatization on python and made a web page about a game called Flyff at roseeilis.com, made a mistake on it and since I didn't use git hub on it I can't undo the changes.

My hobbies are singing, playing video games and listen to music
